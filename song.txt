More than just a dream
More than just a dream
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Forty days and forty nights
I waited for a girl like you to come and save my life
Recall the days I waited for you
You know the ones who said I'd never find someone like you
